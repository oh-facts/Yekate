I want to track with vcs so I am putting here. No point in trying to build. Infancy stage. Look at readme raw code if you wan't to follow the project.

D3D12 renderer.

Tested on win32 w/ clang and on unix-like with winemaker.

I am going to make a vidjya game with this engine.

amÃ©lie said it is good idea to use d3d12.

## Compiling

### Windows 

```
./build.bat
```
Uses clang. Write your own for other compilers. Scroll down to learn how.

### Linux / mac

You need to have wine dev tools installed (winemaker). Should compile without problems.
```
make
```

Look at the Makefile if you want to understand it better.

### Writing your own

If you want to compile yourself, here is all the theory you need.

- Source files        : `code/entry/main.cpp`
- Include directories : `code/`
- compiler flags      : `-nostdlib -lkernel32 -luser32 -ld3d12 -lgdi32`
- linker flags        : `-Xlinker /subsystem:console`

Look for equivalents for your platform / compiler.

For example, I use clang on windows, so I do this:

```
clang -nostdlib code/entry/main.cpp -lkernel32 -luser32 -ld3d12  -lgdi32 -I./code -o out/yk.exe  -Xlinker /subsystem:console
```

I also pass `-g` so I can have debug symbols. You don't need it unless you are developing.

## For contributors

### Contributing

You need to have windows to use d3d12 dev tools. Otherwise, any OS is fine.

Open an issue for anything.

### Project Structure

- `code/`        All of the source code
- `data/`        fonts, images, res

**`code/`**

- `entry/`       Main application entry point. Game will go here.
- `base/`        Common functions. Needs `os/` for crt equivalent functions. Can work without `os/` if stdlib is provided. stdlib is not provided.
- `os/`          contains os code.
- `draw/`        high level drawing layer
- `render/`      gpu api layer
- `gpu/`         shader code
- `third_party/` libraries that I like to use. Embedded inside.
- `scratch/`     temporary test code
- `gen/`         Files generated by the metaprogrammer go here.
- `meta/`        Entry point for the metaprogrammer. Doesn't need to be built unless you are developing.
